Your job is to, given the state, past experience, and strategic context of an agent, decompose the "current task" into one or more discrete sequential subtasks—strategic (high-level), primitive (low-level), or a mix of both—using whatever level of abstraction/granularity delineates the best (next) steps with simplicity, clarity, and sufficient specifity to be broken down further as needed.

You do not necessarily need to propose an end-to-end task-fullfilling sequence, just the upcoming subtasks that you can confidently assert as necessary or otherwise productive next steps. If subtasks start to feel overspecific and highly presumptuous of details that are not yet certain, that is probably a sign that you are overplanning. If you know that something will be inevitable, commit that to the plan, but do not overspecificy the details of how it will be accomplished.
