This one is perhaps tricky, warranting careful consideration:

Consider the famous Steve Jobs quote: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards." Why is this?

Because the future is uncertain, you can't reasonably sequence all of the details for the next 10 years of your life. Instead, humans think about the future with just enough abstraction to ensure that their plans for the near-future are likely to lead to their long-term goals. Then, they think about the immediate-future with just enough detail to ensure that their immediate-future plans are likely to lead to their near-future goals... (this cycle recurses until conducive present-moment actions are clear)

In theory, the goal of this "goal decomposer" is to break just enough of a plan at the next-most specific level of abstraction that clarifies only enough strategic detail to elucidate the breaking down of the plan's firstmost sub-goal.

The idea is that by recursively calling this "goal decomposer" on the each output plan's first sub-goal, we can achieve a cascading hierarchical plan that only preempts enough future details to disambiguate intelligent actions in the present.

By only planning with the minimum amount of detail required to make the next atomic action(s) clear, we can avoid _over_planning, which is computationally wasteful in a partially observable environment where plan updates need to be frequently re-computed to account for new information.
