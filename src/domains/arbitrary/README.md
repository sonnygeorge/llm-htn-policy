# Arbitrary Domain

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§ 

This domain is a catch-all for any arbitrary natural language tasks/scenarios.

Here, there are no set primitive actions.

When this domain is run and a policy decides on an (arbitrary) primitive action, it will not be _literally_ executed in some environment.

Instead, the user will be prompted to input the consequent updated environment state (in arbitrary natural language), essentially as if they were the "dungeon master" of a text-based adventure game.
